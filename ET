This has an audio file which sounds normal when opened with any mp3 player.
Now the real deal open it with audacity. Audacity is a tool for viewing an audio file in raw wave format etc. Now after you 
open the file using audacity go to spectrogram and use the zoom in tool i.e the magnifying glass symbol and zoom in and play now 
you will find some text formed out of the wave format.
