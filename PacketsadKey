This file contains a pacap data and a key file.
Open the pcap file using wireshark.
We see some TCP packets but they do not give out any details so we go and check all possible ways to crack it.
Later upon lot of searching the Internet I remebered that pem files are SSL certificates and are used while transitting data.
So we can assume that this is a SSL encrypted TCP connection.
In wireshark after opening the file 
->EDIT->Preferences
In Prefernces -> Protocol -> Goto SSL 
In SSL type in the IP 127.0.0.1 port 4433 and protocol http
Now in key give the pem that you got with the dump.pacp 
This will decrypt the pacap now check the packets again and there you get the flag.
