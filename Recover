This is a forensics challenge. 
First download and extract the file
run strings on the file and start looking for the flag and there you go. In this strings there is a file being wwritten called the 
flag.txt


Method2....

For this method you'll nedd a tool called autopsy which is inbuilt in kali-linux or for ubuntu or debain you can get it from
the apt-repo 
just do a sudo apt-get autopsy and 
then open it with the file and start checking for the dump of the memory 
In these dumps we can see that flag.bat is writing into a file callled flag.txt
if you look at that written part you'll find the flag.
