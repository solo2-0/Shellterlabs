This jsut like Wallpaper redirects us to an image.
When we download the image and run several tools we got nothing.
But when we ran strings. strings filename.
We can see at the start of the strings the description of the file.
In this description of the file format we can see that it contains EXIF data
EXIF is the data that contains pixel data along with the location data etc.
use exifviwer or the online tool called jeffery exif viewer.
there you find where the image is found.
