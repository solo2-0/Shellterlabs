This challenge is a very easy one if you have the patience.
Now we see that there is a pcap file given with the challenge and we have a lot of tcp streams to check.
Start checking now with the tcp stream 0 and at tcp stream 27 you would find the chat between maria and other guy here a password
is shared with the attacker and then we go forward with the checking and we see that at stream 37 we have a jpeg image shared and
This jpeg is not in the http export objects. Now save this file and then open it with steghide and use the password that we got from
the transaction.
Next we get a zip file and this has the flag but the zip is password protected so we need to use the fcrackzip and crack the 
password there you go you have the flag.
