This challenge is a web challenge from Arahackerday 
Now when we access the challenge we get to a page which has nothing on it.
Next go to the http://lab.shellterlabs.com:33401/robots.txt 
The /robots.txt is a file present in the webpage which is basically to disallow internet bots from crawling. Using this we can see
that 
User-agent: *
Disallow: /memesviewer/
Disallow: /tafacil.txt
so we can access /memesviewer/
no we get to /memesviewer/ file directory structure 
no we can see the flag.txt file here you can go ahead and click on it which will redirect you to that file.
That is it you got the flag.
